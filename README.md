# OC-Pizza---OC-P6_P7_P8
## Presentation
### Context
"OC Pizza" is a young and growing pizzeria group. Created by Franck and Lola, the group specializes in pizzas delivered or to take away. It already has 5 points of sale and plans to open at least 3 more in the next 6 months.

The current IT system no longer meets the needs of the group because it does not allow centralized management of all the pizzerias.
In addition, it is very difficult for managers to follow what is happening in the points of sale.
Finally, the deliverers cannot indicate "live" that the delivery has been made.

### Needs
- Be more efficient in the management of orders, from their receipt to their delivery through their preparation;
- Track in real time the orders placed, in preparation and in delivery;
- Track the stock of remaining ingredients in real time to know which pizzas can still be made;
- Offer a website so that customers can:
  - place their orders, in addition to taking orders by telephone or on site;
  - pay for their order online if they wish â€“ otherwise, they pay directly on delivery;
  - Modify or cancel their order as long as it has not been prepared.
- Propose a memory aid to pizzaiolos indicating the recipe for each pizza.
